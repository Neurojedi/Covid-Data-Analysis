# Covid-Data-Analysis


Welcome to my Exploratory Data Analysis on Covid Data. This is an extended work on my covid data analysis in my last Linear Regression notebook as well as it is an assignment for the Programming with Python (SE307) course that I took last semester. In this notebook, I will be extending the dates of analysis on the previous notebook and adding some time series visualization. In addition, I will also be sharing the MATLAB script that I used for creating the CSV files.
